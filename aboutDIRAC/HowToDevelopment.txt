go to devRoot
disconnect the DIRAC project
and move the DIRAC project to DIRAC_todaydate
this will move also the git project not only the directory
clone again from my remote project
create additional branches
i.e. storagelemenet, dataintegrity
NEVER work in the integration branch
once it is fine,
switch to a given branch
add the files to index (it is like a commit to a local repository)
commit to my remote repo, to the corresponding branch. How do I set the correspondance between a branch of my local repo that I have cloned a branch in the remote repository?
